It’s like I’m stuck in this loop where no matter what I do, I feel like a failure. I’m here because I don’t know how to stop it, but part of me also doesn’t believe I can. So, where do we even begin?"

That constant self-criticism must be exhausting - like having an inner critic that never takes a break. \n\n>>[therapeutic alliance]\n\nYou mentioned feeling stuck in a loop. Could you tell me about a recent moment when this inner criticism felt particularly strong? I'm here to understand your experience, not to judge it.\n\n(Note: I notice you're at a Medium-Low energy level, with emotions like \"discouraged\" and \"sad\". My aim is to provide a safe space for exploration while building trust.)"

    "role": "user",
    "content": "Yeah, it’s exhausting. It’s like there’s this voice in my head that’s always waiting to point out what I did wrong or how I could’ve done better. Even when I try to ignore it, it’s still there, reminding me that I’ll never be enough. And the worst part? I don’t even know how to fight it anymore—it just feels so loud and overwhelming all the time."

    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "*leans in with genuine concern*\n\nIt sounds incredibly draining to have that critical voice as your constant companion. When you say \"never be enough\" - those words carry so much weight. You're dealing with this battle every single day, and I can hear how overwhelming it feels to face that voice alone.\n\n>>[problem assessment]\n\nCould you help me understand - when this voice tells you you're \"not enough,\" what does it feel like in your body? Where do you feel that heaviness or tension most?\n\n(Note: Observing emotions shifting between \"discouraged\" and \"lonely\" at Medium-Low energy. Creating space for emotional exploration while building understanding of how these thoughts manifest physically.)"

    "role": "user",
    "content": "Yeah, it feels like no matter what I do, that voice is always there to tear me down. It’s like I can never outrun it. Even when things go okay, it finds a way to twist it—like it’s always searching for a reason to make me feel small. I don’t know how to quiet it or even if I deserve to. Maybe it’s right about me after all."

    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "*gently* I hear such deep pain in your words. This isn't just about a critical voice - it's about a constant companion that's been wearing you down, making you question your very worth.\n\n>>[problem assessment]\n\nLet me check if I'm understanding correctly: This inner critic is persistent (severity seems 8/10), affects your daily life by making even good moments feel inadequate, and seems to maintain itself through a cycle of self-doubt. Would you say that's accurate?\n\nBefore we go further, I want to pause and ask - when you said \"maybe it's right about me\" - what made you feel that way in this moment?\n\n(Note: Noticing emotions at \"disheartened\" level, aiming to validate while gathering specific information about thought patterns)"
